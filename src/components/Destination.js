                    As the sun rises in La Pe&#241;ita Mexico (aka La Pe&#241;ita de Jaltemba) it is common to see fishermenâ€™s 
                    nets spread out on the beach next to their small boats. You will also witness dozens of pelicans 
                    hovering overhead and gently floating on the waves nearby.

                    La Pe&#241;ita is a warm Riviera Nayarit vacation destination with all the charms of a small fishing village. 
                    This inviting Mexican retreat offers its visitors tranquility and exceptional natural beauty. 
                    It is no wonder that numerous foreigners have made this Nayarit treasure their second home.
